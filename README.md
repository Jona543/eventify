# Eventify

## Getting Started

Start by cloning the project: git clone https://github.com/Jona543/eventify.git

Access the project: cd eventify

Install dependencies: npm install

Create a .env.local file in the root of the project, then copy the example environment file included: cp .env.local.example .env.local

Go to Google Cloud Console, create a new project. Go to API's and Services -> Credentials. Create an OAuth 2.0 Client ID -> Application Type: Web Application -> Authorised redirect URI: http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/google -> Save your GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID and GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET and add them to your .env.local file.

Get a MongoDB URI: Sign up at MongoDB Atlas or run MongoDB locally -> create a cluster and database -> whitelist your IP and create a user -> get your connection string and paste it into MONGODB_URI.

Generate a NextAuth secret using: openssl rand -base64 32 -> Paste the output into NEXTAUTH_SECRET.

Seed your new database with the provided sample data using: node scripts/seed.js

Make sure your .env.local contains MONGODB_URI so the script can connect.

Then. run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
